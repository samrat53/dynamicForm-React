As my process of learning continues, this GitHub repository showcases a simple and interactive web form built using React.js and TypeScript. The form dynamically updates the heading with your inputted name, and calculates and displays the number of days left until your next birthday. The project also features a stylish footer imported from Bootstrap for added design flair.

Key Features:
- Utilizes React.js and TypeScript for dynamic and type-safe development.
- Automatically updates the heading with your typed name in real-time.
- Calculates and displays the remaining days until your next birthday.
- Presents a congratulatory alert message on your birthday.
- Styled with an appealing Bootstrap footer for a polished look and feel.

Explore the code to learn how to create engaging user interfaces and leverage dynamic functionalities using React.js and TypeScript.
Feel free to clone, modify, and expand upon this project to enhance your skills in web development with React.js and TypeScript.
