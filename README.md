As my process of learning continues, this a simple form, scratch implementation using React.js and typescript, footer imported from bootstrap.

This dynamically updates the name at the heading as you start typing in the placeholder. Also once you enter your next birthday date, it will show number of days left and will wish you in an alert. All done using React.js and Typescript.
